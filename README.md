# FAQs
* Do you steal my password?
    * This program exits before you even log in, so you're safe. Plus, it's a open software.
* Doesn't work. What do I do?
    * Please Use "Issue" tab in Github. ~~Or you could debug it for me!~~
* Can you use multiple threads?
    * I tried it, but it gave me bad results(repeating results). So I'm not planning to implement it.
* Your code sucks!
    * Errmm... I've only spent 30 minutes here! Don't expect too much. 

Good luck & Have fun!
